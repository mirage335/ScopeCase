Enhanced enclosure for DSO Nano pocket oscilloscope. Facillitates BNC connectors, high-speed impedance tester (decade resistor), high-speed high-versatility diode tester, amplifier high-gain mode, high-speed multi-gigahertz envelope detector, and a larger battery.

__DecadeResistor__
See "Electronics/ResistanceProbeSchematic.png" subfolder for correct implementation of a decade resistor as an impedance tester and diode tester.

For diode testing, simply select a known resistance providing adequate current (often 1k-10k), and measure the voltage drop. Especially helpful for testing LEDs.

Impedance can be measured by the following equation. The high-speed offered by the onboard oscilloscope and variable frequency signal generator makes this applicable to inductors, capacitors, transformers, and even transistor/phototransistor/optoisolator outputs.

RT=(o*RK)/(i-o)
x is the unknown resistance
r is the known resistance (selected by switches)
o is the output voltage (load voltage)
i is the input voltage supplied through power pins (next to switches, normally connected to button-cell battery) 

__FieldStrengthProbe__
See "Electronics/FieldStrengthProbeSchematic.png" for the envelope detector.

Essentially a crystal radio without any resonant filter, this allows the low-frequency (~100kHz bandwidth) DSO Nano oscilloscope to 'see' multi-gigahertz signals. Even more interesting is the possibility to see timing patterns. Interesting experiments include placing an antenna close to microwave ovens and WiFi accesspoints. Beacon frames are clearly visible in the latter case.

__HighGainMode__
Bypass R13 on the DSO Nano PCB with a lower-value resistor to increase gain when desired.

__FutureWork__
Simple IIR biquad filters would be useful for rejecting unwanted noise (ie. 60Hz).
